# TypeScript, async generators, and Redis search

The repository has some sample code showing you have to use generators, async generatros, and how to use them in combination with Redis search. I made this as part of a video talking about the same topic.

## Getting Started

This is pretty easy. Just follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have an instance of Redis Stack running locally on port 6379. If you have it somewhere else, edit the code in `main.ts` to point to where your Redis is. The comments will guide you. If you don't have it, [get it now](https://redis.io/downloads/#redis-stack-downloads).
3. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
4. Run `npm run test` and watch the unit tests pass.

Once you're there, take a look at the code and learn from it. Again, the comments will guide you.
